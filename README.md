# Form Builder Application

This project is a **Form Builder Application** built with the [formbuilder.dev](https://formbuilder.dev) React library for the frontend and Django as the backend. It enables users to create customizable form widgets with a user-friendly, drag-and-drop interface and dynamically generates embed codes for each form.

## Features
- **Drag-and-Drop Form Building**: Easily add and arrange form elements with a drag-and-drop interface.
- **Customizable Form Widgets**: Create and configure various form widgets, including text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdowns, and more.
- **Dynamic Configuration Options**: Adjust settings like validation, labels, placeholders, and other attributes for each widget.
- **Embed Code Generation**: Each form widget has a unique embed code generated by the Django backend, making it easy to integrate forms into other websites.
- **Preview Mode**: Instantly preview how your form will appear to end users.

This application provides a convenient way to design and embed forms for different purposes, such as surveys, feedback forms, registrations, and more, without needing to write complex code.
